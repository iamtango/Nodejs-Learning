Node.js is a powerful, open-source runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, primarily on the server side. Built on Google Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. It employs an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

This architecture allows Node.js to handle multiple requests simultaneously without waiting for a task to complete, which significantly improves performance for applications that require high concurrency. Additionally, its package manager, npm, provides access to a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and tools, enabling developers to quickly add new features and functionalities to their applications.
